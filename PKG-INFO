Description: This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
        runs just as many compilations as necessary. The module system provides a
        great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
        intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
        standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, dvipdfm, pdftex,
        makeindex. A good number of standard packages are supported, including
        graphics/graphicx (with automatic conversion between various formats and
        Metapost compilation).
